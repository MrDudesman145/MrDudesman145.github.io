    <h2>What You Learn in a Class</h2>
    <p class="p">
      In a manufacturing technology class, students learn about the processes, equipment, and technologies used to create products. This includes hands-on experience with various machines, like CNC mills and lathes, as well as learning about topics such as CAD/CAM, quality control, and lean manufacturing. The curriculum often combines theoretical knowledge with practical application to prepare students for entry-level manufacturing positions.
