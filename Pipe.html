    <p><h1>Pipe Welding</h1>
    <p class="p">Pipe welding is a specialized form of welding used to join pipes together, crucial in industries like oil and gas, chemical processing, and utilities. It employs various welding techniques, primarily arc welding processes like MIG and TIG welding, to create secure and leak-proof connections. The integrity of pipe welds is vital for the safe transport of materials, making it a critical skill in these industries.
